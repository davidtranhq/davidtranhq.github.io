Quake III Arena is critically acclaimed FPS from 1999
Part of what stood this game out from the rest was impressive graphics
what allowed this game its superior graphics were clever optimizations of the game engine
one of these optimizations: infamous approximation of the inverse sqrt:

``` C
float Q_rsqrt( float number )
{
	long i;
	float x2, y;
	const float threehalfs = 1.5F;

	x2 = number * 0.5F;
	y  = number;
	i  = * ( long * ) &y;                       // evil floating point bit level hacking
	i  = 0x5f3759df - ( i >> 1 );               // what the fuck? 
	y  = * ( float * ) &i;
	y  = y * ( threehalfs - ( x2 * y * y ) );   // 1st iteration
//	y  = y * ( threehalfs - ( x2 * y * y ) );   // 2nd iteration, this can be removed

	return y;
}
```
