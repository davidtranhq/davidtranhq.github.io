# Direct and Semidirect Products and Abelian Groups

## Direct Products

**Definition**: The **direct product** $G_1 \times G_2 \times \dots$ for groups $G_1, G_2, \dots$ with operations $\star_1, \star_2, \dots$, respectively, is the set of $n$-tuples $(g_1, \dots, g_n)$ (if finite) or sequences (if infinite) with the operation defined componentwise.

**Proposition 1**: If $G_1, \dots, G_n$ are groups, their direct product is a group of order $\prod \vert G_i \vert$ (if any $G_i$ is infinite, so is the direct product).

*Proof*: Trivial.

**Proposition 2**: Let $G_1, \dots, G_n$ be groups and $G$ their direct product.
1. $G_i \cong \lbrace (1, \dots, 1, g_i, 1, \dots, 1) \mid g_i \in G_i \rbrace$ and $G_i \trianglelefteq G$ with

$$
G/G_i \cong G_1 \times \dots \times G_{i - 1} \times G_{i + 1} \times \dots \times G_n
$$

2. For each fixed $i$ one can define $\pi_i: G \to G_i$ by $\pi_i(g_1, \dots, g_n)) = g_i$, which is a surjective homomorphism with kernel $G/G_i$.
3. If $x \in G_i$ and $y \in G_j$ for $i \neq j$, then $xy = yx$.

*Proof*: $(1)$ The map for the first isomorphism is given by $g_i \mapsto (1, \dots, 1, g_i, 1, \dots, 1)$. For the second part, note that 

$$
\varphi: G \to G_1 \times \dots \times G_{i  -1} \times G_{i + 1} \times \dots \times G_n
$$

defined by $(\varphi(g_1, \dots, g_n)) = (g_1, \dots, g_{i - 1}, g_{i + 1}, \dots, g_n)$ is a homomorphism with kernel $G_i$.

$(2)$ It is clear that this map is a surjective homomorphism: to see the kernel note that $G/G_i \cong \lbrace (g_1, \dots, g_{i - 1}, 1, g_{i + 1}, \dots, g_n) \mid g_j \in G_j \forall j \neq i \rbrace$.

$(3)$ Trivial.

## The Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups

**Definition**: $G$ is **finitely generated** if there exists a finite $X \subseteq G$ such that $G = \langle X \rangle$.

**Definition**: Let $r \in \mathbb Z_{\geq 0}$. Then $\mathbb Z^r = \mathbb Z \times \dots \times \mathbb Z$ ($r$ times) is the **free Abelian group of rank $r$**. When $r = 0$, $\mathbb Z^0 = 1$.

**Examples**:
1. $\mathbb Z$ is finitely generated by $\lbrace 1 \rbrace$
2. $\mathbb Z^n$ is finitely generated by $\lbrace (1, 0, \dots, 0), (0, 1, 0, \dots, 0), \dots, (0, 0, \dots, 0, 1) \rbrace$.

**Theorem 3 (Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups, Invariant Form)**: Let $G$ be a finitely generated Abelian group. Then
1. $G \cong \mathbb Z^r \times Z_{n_1} \times \dots \times Z_{n_s}$ for some $r \geq 0$ and $n_j \geq 2$. such that $n_j \mid n_{j - 1} \mid \dots \mid n_2 \mid n_1$
2. The decomopsition in $(1)$ is unique and called the **invariant decomposition of $G$**. That is, if also $G \cong \mathbb Z^t \times Z_{m _1} \times \dots \times Z_{m_k}$ with the same constraints, then $r = t$ and $k = s$, and $m_j = n_j$, for all $j$.

*Proof*: Ring theory. $\blacksquare$

**Definition**: The exponent $r$ in the $\mathbb Z^r$ term of the invariant decomposition is called the **Betti number of $G$** or the **free rank of $G$**, and $n_1, \dots, n_s$ are the **invariants of $G$**.

**Remarks**:
1. If $G$ is **Abelian** , then $T(G) = \lbrace g \in G : \vert g \vert \lt \infty \rbrace \leq G$ is the **torsion component** of $G$. Also, $T(G) \cong Z_{n_1} \times \dots \times Z_{n_s}$.
2. $G$ is a Abelian group if its free rank is 0.
3. Suppose $G$ is a finite abelian group with $\vert G \vert = n$. Then $n = \prod n_i$. Let $p$ be prime. Then if $p \mid n$ then $p \mid n_1$.

**Corollary 4**: If $n$ is the product of distinct primes, then up to isomorphism the only abelian group of order $n$ is the cyclic group of order $n$, $Z_n$

*Proof*: By Theorem 3, since $n_1 \mid n_2 \mid \dots$ and $n$ is the product of its invariant factors, any prime divisor of $n$ must divide $n_1$. But $n_1$ is prime, so $n_1 = n$, so by Theorem 3, $G \cong Z_n$. $\blacksquare$

**Remark**: $G$ is an Abelian group if its free rank is 0.

**Theorem 5**: Let $G$ be an abelian group of order $n \gt 1$ with unique prime factorization $n = p_1^{\alpha_1}\dots p_k^{\alpha_k}$. Then
1. $G \cong A_1 \times \dots \times A_k$ with $\vert A_i \vert = p_i^{\alpha_i}$
2. For each $A$ in the above with $\vert A \vert = p^\alpha$,

$$
A \cong Z_{p^\beta_1} \times \dots Z_{p^\beta_t}
$$

with $\beta_1 \geq \dots \geq \beta_t \geq 1$ and $\sum \beta = \alpha$.

3. The decomposition in $(1)$ and $(2)$ is unique.

**Definition**: The integers $p^{\beta_j}$ in Theorem 5 are the **elementary divisors of $G$**. The decomposition in the same theory is the **elementary divisor decomposition of $G$**.

**Remark**: Theorem 5 states that finite abelian groups are isomorphic to the direct product of its Sylow subgroups.

**Example**: Listing all abelian groups of order $n$.

1. Find the prime factor decomposition of $n$: $p_1^{\alpha_1} \dots p_n^{\alpha_n}$.
2. By Theorem 5, $\vert A_i \vert = p_i^{\alpha_i}$ for each $i$.
3. Consider every partition of $\alpha_i = \beta_1 + \dots + \beta_t$.
4. By Theorem 3, $A_i \cong Z_{\beta_1} \times \dots \times Z_{\beta_t}$ where $\beta_1, \dots, \beta_t$ is some partition of $\alpha_i$.
5. An abelian group of order $n$ is any combination of one of the decompositions of each $A_i$.

$n = 1800 = 2^33^25^2$, so we have
* $Z_8 \times Z_9 \times Z_{25}$
* $Z_8 \times Z_9 \times (Z_5 \times Z_5)$
* $(Z_4 \times Z_2) \times (Z_3 \times Z_3) \times Z_{25}$,
etc.

**Proposition 6**: Let $m, n \in \mathbb Z^+$. Then
1. $Z_m \times Z_n \cong Z_{mn}$ if and only if $(m, n) = 1$.
2. If $n = p_1^{\alpha_1} \dots p_k^{\alpha_k}$ then $Z_n \cong Z_{p_1^{\alpha_1}} \times \dots \times Z_{p_k^{\alpha_k}}$.

### Obtaining Elementary Divisors from Invariant Factors

If $G$ is abelian with type $(n_1, \dots, n_s)$ where each $n_i$ has prime factor decomposition $n_i = p_1^{\beta_{i1}} \dots p_k^{\beta_{ik}}$, then the elementary divisors of $G$ are precisely the $p_j^{\beta_{jt}}$ factors.

This process also works if $G$ is expressed as its cyclic decomposition, e.g. $G \cong Z_6 \times Z_{15}$ (note that these aren't invariant factors since $6 \nmid 15$).

### Obtaining Invariant Factors from Elementary Divisors

Create a non-increasing list of prime powers for each prime $p$. Make these lists equal by adding "padding" of 1's. Then, form the invariant factors by taking the product of the $i$th integer in each of the lists.

For example, for $G$ with elementary divisors 2, 3, 2, 25, 3, form the lists

$p = 2$|$p = 3$|$p = 5$|
---|---|---|
2|3|25
2|3|1
|2|1|1

then the invariant factors are $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 25$, $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 1$, $2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1$, so

$$
G \cong Z_{150} \times Z_6 \times Z_2
$$

**Definition**:
1. If $G$ is a finite abelian group of type $(n_1, \dots, n_t)$, then $t$ is the **rank** of $G$.
2. If $G$ is any group, the **exponent of $G$** is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $x^n = 1$ for all $x \in G$.

## Recognizing Direct Products

**Definition**: Let $G$ be a group, $x, y \in G$, and $A, B$ non-empty subsetes of $G$.
1. Define $[x, y] = x^{-1}y^{-1}xy$ is the **commutator** of $x$ and $y$
2. Define $[A, B] = \langle [a, b] \mid a \in A, b \in B \rangle$ the group generated by commutators of elements from $A$ and from $B$.
3. Define $G' = \langle [x, y] \mid x, y \in G \rangle$, the subgroup of $G$ generated by commutators of elements from $G$, called the **commutator subgroup** of $G$.

**Proposition 7**: Let $G$ be a group, $x, y \in G$ and $H \leq G$.
1. $xy = yx[x, y]$
2. $H \trianglelefteq G$ if and only if $[H, G] \leq H$.
3. $\sigma[x, y] = [\sigma(x), \sigma(y)]$ for any automorphism $\sigma$ of $G$, $G'$ char $G$ and $G/G'$ is abelian.
4. $G/G'$ is the largest abelian quotient of $G$: $H \trianglelefteq G$ and $G/H$ is abelian if and only if $G' \leq H$.
5. If $\varphi: G \to A$ is any homomorphism of $G$ into an abelian group $A$, then $\varphi$ factors through $G'$, i.e. $G' \leq \operatorname{ker} \varphi$ and $\varphi = \phi \circ \pi$ for some $\phi: G/G' \to A$ (where $\pi$) is the natural homomorphism.

*Proof*: $(1)$ By definition.

$(2)$ If $H \trianglelefteq G$, then $h^{-1}g^{-1}hg \in h^{-1}H = H$, so $[H, G] \leq H$. Conversely if $h^{-1}g^{-1}hg \in H$, then $g^{-1}hg \in H$ so $H$ is normal.

$(3)$ Let $x, y \in G$. Then $\sigma[x, y] = \sigma(x^{-1}y^{-1}xy) = \sigma(x)^{-1}\sigma(y)^{-1}\sigma(x)\sigma(y) = [\sigma(x), \sigma(y)]$. So $\sigma$ maps the commutators of $G$ bijectively onto itself. Since the commutators are a generating set of $G'$, $\sigma(G') = G'$, that is, $G'$ char $G$.

Finally, we show $G/G'$ is abelian. Let $xG', yG' \in G/G'$. Then $(xG')(yG') = (xy)G' = (yx[x, y])G' = (yx)G'$.

$(4)$ Suppose $H \trianglelefteq G$ with $G/H$ abelian. Then $(xy)H = (yx)H$ for $x, y \in G$ so $[x, y]H = H$, so $G' \leq H$. Conversely if $G' \leq H$, then since $G/G'$ is abelian by $(3)$, every subgroup of $G/G'$ is normal, including $H/G'$. So by the Lattice Isomorphism Theorem, $H \trianglelefteq G$. And by the Third Isomorphism Theorem, $G/H \cong (G/G')/(H/G')$, so $G/H$ is abelian.

$(5)$ Let $H = \operatorname{ker} \varphi$. Then $G' \leq H$ by $(4)$. TODO.

**Proposition 8**: Let $H, K \leq G$. The number of distinct ways of writing each element of $HK$ in the form $hk$ for some $h \in H, k \in K$ is $\vert H \cap K \vert$.

*Proof*: Let $x \in HK$. Since $HK = \bigcup_{h \in H} hK$ and the cosets of $K$ partition $HK$, $x$ is in some unique coset $hK$. The number of ways of writing $
