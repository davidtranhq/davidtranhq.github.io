# Quotient Groups and Homomorphisms

## Definition and Examples

**Definition**: Let $\varphi: G \to H$ be a homomoprhism. A **fiber** of $\varphi$ is a subset of $G$ that maps to a single element in $H$.

**Definition**: If $\varphi: G \to H$ is a homomorphism, then the **kernel of $\varphi$** is the fiber mapping to the identity element in $H$.

**Proposition 1**: Let $G, H$ be groups and $\varphi: G \to H$ a homomorphism.
1. Identity is preserved under homomorphism.
2. Inverse is preserved under homomorphism.
3. Powers preserved under homomorphism.
4. The kernel is a subgroup of $G$.
5. The image of $G$ under $\varphi$ is a subgroup of $H$.
