I am a CS + Math undergraduate at the University of Western Ontario.

Currently, I'm doing research in machine learning and its applications to neuroscience at [The Brain and Mind Institute](https://www.uwo.ca/bmi/).

I also occasionally write about interesting topics and problems I've come across. 
(Check them out [here](/posts)!)

See [/notes](/notes) for some of my class notes and [/projects](/projects) for projects I've made and worked on.
