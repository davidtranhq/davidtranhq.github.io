I graduated with a Bachelor's from the University of Western Ontario, double-majoring in Computer Science and Pure Mathematics.

In the past, I've done research in machine learning and its applications to neuroscience at [The Brain and Mind Institute](https://www.uwo.ca/bmi/): specifically in the topics of approximative inference, hidden Markov models, and unsupervised Bayesian learning.

I've also interned as a software engineer at [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/) and [Apple](https://www.apple.com).

Currently, I'm a research engineer on the [global quantitative trading team at Citadel](https://www.citadel.com/what-we-do/global-quantitative-strategies/).
