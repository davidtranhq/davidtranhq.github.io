I am a second-year CS + Math undergraduate at the University of Western Ontario.
Most of my work consists of open-source contributions to libraries and
[personal projects](/projects) that I find useful and/or fun.

Currently, I'm doing research in machine learning and its applications to neuroscience at [The Brain and Mind Institute](https://www.uwo.ca/bmi/).

I also occasionally write about interesting topics and problems I've come across.
