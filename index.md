I am a second-year CS + Math undergraduate at the University of Western Ontario.
Most of my work consists of open-source contributions to libraries such as [MathJS](mathjs.org) and
[personal projects](/projects) that I find useful and/or fun.

I also occasionally write about interesting topics and problems I've come across. 
(Check them out [here!](/posts))

Currently seeking Summer 2022 SWE internships.
