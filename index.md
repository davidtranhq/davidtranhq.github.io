I am a CS + Math undergraduate at the University of Western Ontario.

In the past, I've done research in machine learning and its applications to neuroscience at [The Brain and Mind Institute](https://www.uwo.ca/bmi/): specifically in the problems of approximative inference, hidden Markov models, and unsupervised Bayesian learning.

I've also interned as a software engineer at [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/).

I write about interesting topics and problems I've come across. 
(Check them out [here](/posts)!)

See [/notes](/notes) for my class notes and [/projects](/projects) for projects I've made and worked on.
